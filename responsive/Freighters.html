<H1> Freighters/Production Ships</H1>
<p>
    In Cosmoteer, a production ship plays a crucial role in supporting your fleet's sustainability, growth, and strategic flexibility. Here's why having one is important:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Resource Management: A production ship allows you to create or repair various components, like weapons, armor, and parts for your ships. This is important because in long-term campaigns or battles, you will run out of these supplies, especially after heavy engagements. The ability to craft or repair them on the go helps you stay operational without having to rely on external sources or trading stations.</li>
    <li>Self-Sufficiency: Instead of needing to return to a station or rely on looting to acquire essential parts, a production ship makes you self-sufficient. This reduces downtime, gives you the freedom to venture further into enemy territory, or explore new sectors of the game without constantly being dependent on external supply lines.
    </li>
    <li>Strategic Flexibility: With a production ship, you can adapt quickly to different battle situations by producing specific types of weapons, shields, or parts that might be needed in response to enemy tactics or threats. It allows you to tailor your fleet’s capabilities during a campaign without needing to start from scratch each time.</li>
    <li>Repairs and Maintenance: It's not just about production; a production ship can also assist in repairing your ships during battles or after engagements. Keeping your fleet at peak performance is essential for survival, especially during prolonged missions.</li>
    <li>Cost-Efficiency: Instead of buying resources or ships, a production ship helps you create them yourself, saving you resources over time. If you have the materials, you can produce exactly what you need, when you need it, making it a more efficient long-term solution.</li>
    <li>Tactical Deployment: A production ship can be an excellent tactical asset. For instance, in larger fleet setups, you can assign it a role as a support vessel, allowing your other ships to focus on offense while the production ship handles the logistics and ensures your fleet doesn’t run out of vital components.</li>
</ul>

<p>In summary, a production ship offers sustainability, flexibility, and autonomy, turning your fleet into a self-sufficient, adaptable force capable of taking on prolonged campaigns and surviving in hostile environments.</p>
