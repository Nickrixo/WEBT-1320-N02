                <p> Cosmoteer is an innovative sandbox game where you design huge starships, and efficiently prep them for battle. By using your own clever and creative engineering skills, you can bring to life the ultimate battle cruiser that will conquer the comsos. In order to do so, however, you must learn to manage your resources and crew effectively and optimally. There are two game main game modes to choose from: You can play Creative Mode to let your boundless imagination take flight without restrictions, or you can test your mettle in Career Mode where you must start from humble beginnings, and earn your keep by completing quests, mining resources, and gradually upgrading your ship to take on even bigger challenges.You can learn more about the game and its mechanics on the <a href="https://cosmoteer.wiki.gg/wiki/Cosmoteer_Wiki" target="_blank">Wiki</a>.</p>

                <h2 class="Heading_Style">What Weapon Will YOU Choose?</h2>
                <p>There are a plethora of weapon types to equip onto your vessel of absolute destruction. Options vary from short range to long range laser and ballistic weapons. Typically, laser-based weapons have the most range, and they don't require ammo. Whereas ballistic weapons have shorter range (except for <a href="https://cosmoteer.wiki.gg/wiki/Missile_%26_Mine_Launcher" target="_blank">Missles</a> and <a href="https://cosmoteer.wiki.gg/wiki/Railgun_Launcher_Module" target="_blank">Railguns</a>) but pack more of a punch. Your choice of weaponry is entirely up to your own free will. You can even mix and match if you want to. Maybe you could build a ship with both lasers and ballistics, or better yet, why not EVERY weapon in the arsenal. Now THAT would be some raw firepower. </p>
