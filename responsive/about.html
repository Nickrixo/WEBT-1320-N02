    Factions
</h1>

<p>
    In the universe of Cosmoteer, there are currently four main factions:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>The Fringe</li>
    <li>The Cabal</li>
    <li>The Imperium</li>
    <li>The Monolith</li>
</ul>

<p>
    Each of these factions feature their own unique designs, and typically favor a specific theme of weapon type. Although each faction still utilizes all wepaon types in some form in their builds, some specific types are more favored. The Fringe are known as scavengers, and their ships appear more scraplike. They usually favor missiles and cannons withinin their arsenal. The Cabal are known as religious authoritarians. Their ships are elegant  and ethereal in aesthetic, and they utilize powerful ion lasers to display their dogmatic might. The Imperium are an ambitious military empire focused on designing warships of mass destruction. Their designs favor that of avian aesthetics with many of their ship being named after terrestrial birds. Their favored weapon of choice are missiles, specifically nukes. Lastly, the Monolith are a highly advanced and wealthy faction whose main combative focus isn't on weapons, but on defenses, where many of their ships heavily feature forcefields reinforced by heavy armor plating. They do not favor any weapon specifically. </p>
