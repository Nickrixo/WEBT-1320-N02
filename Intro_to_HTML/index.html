        <h1>Cosmoteer</h1>
        <p> Cosmoteer is an innovative sandbox game where you design huge starships, and efficiently prep them for battle. By using your own clever and creative engineering skills, you can bring to life the ultimate battle cruiser that will conquer the comsos. In order to do so, however, you must learn to manage your resources and crew effectively and optimally. There are two game main game modes to choose from: You can play Creative Mode to let your boundless imagination take flight without restrictions, or you can test your mettle in Career Mode where you must start from humble beginnings, and earn your keep by completing quests, mining resources, and gradually upgrading your ship to take on even bigger challenges.You can learn more about the game and its mechanics on the <a href="https://cosmoteer.wiki.gg/wiki/Cosmoteer_Wiki" target="_blank">Wiki</a>.</p>
